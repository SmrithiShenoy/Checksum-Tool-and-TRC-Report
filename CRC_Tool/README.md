# CRC GUI Tool

A Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) application that performs Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) calculations on binary messages. This tool allows users to input a message and a CRC key (polynomial), and it computes the transmitted message with the CRC appended, along with detailed binary division steps.

Features:
- Input fields for binary message and CRC key
- Displays:
  - Original message
  - CRC key
  - Transmitted message (message + CRC remainder)
  - Detailed CRC division steps
- Simple and intuitive interface built with `tkinter`
- Great for educational purposes and protocol debugging

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- tkinter

Running the Application:
1. Clone the repository or download the `crcgui.py` file.
2. Navigate to the directory in your terminal.
3. Run the script using Python
